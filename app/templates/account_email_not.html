<h3>please check and verify your email address</h3>
<p>
During our first few months of testing, many incorrect or invalid email addresses have caused us quite a few headaches, and more than a few late nights. â€¨
</p>
<p>
A lack of email verification has also made it harder for us to prevent spam being posted on the site.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, we now require that all writers confirm and verify a valid email address.
</p>
<p>
We know this is a bit of a pain, but we appreciate your assistance in making our site more secure.
</p>

<br/>
<p>
First, please make sure your email address is correct. If not, please correct it now.<br/>
Then click to save and verify your email.<br/>
A verification link will be sent to the address you provide.<br/>
<b>
You will need to complete this verification before you can write more opinions or make comments on WriteHere.
