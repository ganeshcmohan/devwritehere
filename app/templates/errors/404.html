            <p>â€œEvery writer I know has trouble writing.â€ </p>
            <span class="signed">- Joseph Heller</span>
            
            <p>â€œThere is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed.â€</p>

            <p>â€œIf you are using dialogue â€” say it aloud as you write it. Only then will it have the sound of speech.â€ </p>
            <span class="signed">- John Steinback</span>
            
            <p>â€œCut out all those exclamation marks. An exclamation mark is like laughing at your own joke.â€ </p>
            <span class="signed">- F. Scott Fitzgerald</span>
            
            <p>â€œThe writerâ€™s job is to get the main character up a tree, and then once they are up there, throw rocks at them.â€ </p>
            <span class="signed">- Vladimir Nabokov</span>
            
            <p>â€œGet it down. Take Chances. It may be bad, but it's the only way you can do anything really good.â€ </p>

            <p>â€œWhen your story is ready for rewrite, cut it to the bone. Get rid of every ounce of excess fat. This is going to hurt; revising a story down to the bare essentials is always a little like murdering children, but it must be done.â€ </p>
            <span class="signed">- Stephen King</span>
