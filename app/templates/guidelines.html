                <br />

                When I started writing for a living, one of the best pieces of advice ever offered to me was: "Never
                    write something you would not want your grandmother to read."<br /><br />

                It's genius really, because when you write by that standard, you focus on the communication of your ideas
                    and the structure of your argument.<br /><br />

                And when you focus on these most important aspects of writing you are not only more persuasive, and appear
                    more intelligent, you invariably find that being nasty, being deceitful or being a potty mouth simply
                    gets in the way.<br /><br />

                So, whenever you WriteHere we ask that you abide by three universal principles we know your grandmother
                    would approve of:<br /><br />

                - common courtesy (be nice)<br />
                - common decency (don't steal the work of others and don't pretend to be someone you're not)<br />
                - and common sense â€“ (don't break the law).<br /><br />

                We respect, defend and work tirelessly to promote the right to free speech. It's one of the foundations
                    of WriteHere. Please do not abuse the privilege.<br /><br />
